Question: what are the pivot-based baselines?
Gold:
	pivoting, pivoting$_{\rm m}$
	firstly translates a source language into the pivot language which is later translated to the target language
Predicted:
	The pivot-based baselines in the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) refer to the common strategy of using a pivot language to facilitate translation between two low-resource languages that lack direct parallel data. In this approach, the source language is first translated into the pivot language and then further translated into the target language. This method aims to overcome the challenges of poor performance in low-resource language pairs by leveraging the availability of rich-resource languages.

Some common pivot-based methods include:

1. Pivoting: This method involves translating the source language to the pivot language and then translating the pivot language to the target language. It is a sequential translation process that relies on the pivot language as an intermediary step.

2. Pivot-synthetic: This approach involves training a source$\rightarrow $target model using pseudo data generated from source-pivot or pivot-target parallel data. It aims to improve translation performance by utilizing synthetic data for training.

While pivot-based methods can achieve reasonable performance, they often face challenges such as increased computational complexity, parameter scalability with the number of source languages, and error propagation issues resulting from multiple translation steps.

In the realm of NMT, pivot-based methods have been a popular strategy for handling translation tasks involving low-resource language pairs. However, they may not always be the most efficient or effective solution, especially in scenarios where direct parallel data between the source and target languages is not available. Other approaches such as transfer learning, multilingual NMT, and unsupervised NMT have also been explored to address the challenges of translation between low-resource or zero-resource language pairs.

Question: What predictive model do they build?
Gold:
	logistic regression models
	logistic regression models based on unigram bag-of-words features (BOW), sentiment signals (SENT), the linguistic features from our earlier analyses (LING), and combinations of these features.
Predicted:
	The predictive model discussed in the documentation is aimed at classifying dogmatic posts from Reddit. It is a statistical model of dogmatism that utilizes linguistic signals to predict the level of dogmatism in a post. The model is trained on a corpus of 5,000 Reddit posts annotated with levels of dogmatism. The model's predictions are guided by various feature sets that align with psychological theories of dogmatism.

The model is used to answer several research questions, such as identifying topics that attract the highest levels of dogmatism, understanding how dogmatic beliefs cluster, exploring the influence of dogmatism on conversations in social media, and examining the relationship between user behaviors and dogmatism.

To build the classifier, linguistic features inspired by psychology are utilized, including certainty, tentativeness, insight, perception, comparison, relativity, pronouns, verb tense, sentiment, interrogative language, and negation. These features are analyzed using techniques like odds ratios and statistical tests to assess their predictive power in identifying dogmatic language.

The classification results show that linguistic features contribute significantly to predicting dogmatism, with the model achieving high accuracy within the Reddit dataset and on a separate dataset of New York Times comments. The model combines linguistic features with other behavioral metrics to create a comprehensive understanding of dogmatism in online conversations.

Overall, the predictive model serves as a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding dogmatic language in online discussions, shedding light on the behaviors and patterns associated with dogmatism in social media interactions.

Specifically, ALCrowd outperforms strong baseline systems such as CRF and LSTM-CRF, showing an advantage with +1.08 F1 improvement on the DL-PS dataset, +1.24 on EC-MT, and +2.38 on EC-UQ. The results indicate that adding crowd-annotation learning through adversarial training is highly effective in building NER systems.

The system demonstrates its ability to extract worker-independent features, leading to better performance in identifying entities in both dialog and e-commerce domains. The adversarial training approach utilized in ALCrowd provides a mechanism to reduce noise from non-expert annotations and improve the overall accuracy of the NER system.

The impact of pretrained character embeddings on the system's performance is also significant, as models with pretrained embeddings show a marked improvement over those with random embeddings. This highlights the importance of leveraging pretraining techniques to enhance feature representation in NER tasks.

Overall, the results of the study suggest that the proposed system, ALCrowd, offers a promising solution for Chinese NER tasks by effectively leveraging crowd annotations and adversarial training to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the NER system.
