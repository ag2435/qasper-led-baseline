        "question": "what are the pivot-based baselines?",
        "answer": "The pivot-based baselines in the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) refer to the common strategy of using a pivot language to facilitate translation between two low-resource languages that lack direct parallel data. In this approach, the source language is first translated into the pivot language and then further translated into the target language. This method aims to overcome the challenges of poor performance in low-resource language pairs by leveraging the availability of rich-resource languages.\n\nSome common pivot-based methods include:\n\n1. Pivoting: This method involves translating the source language to the pivot language and then translating the pivot language to the target language. It is a sequential translation process that relies on the pivot language as an intermediary step.\n\n2. Pivot-synthetic: This approach involves training a source$\\rightarrow $target model using pseudo data generated from source-pivot or pivot-target parallel data. It aims to improve translation performance by utilizing synthetic data for training.\n\nWhile pivot-based methods can achieve reasonable performance, they often face challenges such as increased computational complexity, parameter scalability with the number of source languages, and error propagation issues resulting from multiple translation steps.\n\nIn the realm of NMT, pivot-based methods have been a popular strategy for handling translation tasks involving low-resource language pairs. However, they may not always be the most efficient or effective solution, especially in scenarios where direct parallel data between the source and target languages is not available.
